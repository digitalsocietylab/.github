The [Digital Society Lab](https://digitalsocietylab.org/) is an interdisciplinary research centre at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) that engages through scholarship and praxis with the complex societal transformations that have accompanied the digital era. 

The lab endeavours to advance the study of the social, political, and economic impacts of digital technologies while also harnessing the potential of these technologies for scientific and social innovation. 

The lab also serves as a training hub for the next generation of scholars and policy leaders seeking to address some of the most pressing challenges associated with emergent digital technologies.
